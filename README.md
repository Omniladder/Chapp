# Description
**Chapp.** is a Gamified Open-source Texting-based Social Media Platform in the sense that it allows for achievements and competitive elements with friends by tracking number of days in a row you've communicated and compeitive achievements to show who you and your friends have been talking too. Loosely based on Snapchat Chapp. Differentiates itself with a PC and text oriented design allowing texting on the computer while maintaining a responsive design for those on mobile as well as an increased accuracy in achivement status. Its open-source nature also allows for private hosting and internal usage among friend groups as well as allowing for modified versions of the program. Designed to both be a learning experience as well as valuable Chapp. utilizes Javascript as its complete stack utilzing npm as well as Express.JS and utilizes Docker and a growing number of other Infrastructure based tools to make running your own server as simple as possible.
