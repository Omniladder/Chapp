# Description
**Chapp** is a *Gamified Open-source Texting-based Social Media Platform* in the sense that it allows for **achievements** and **competitive** elements with friends by tracking number of days in a row you've communicated and compeitive achievements to show who you and your friends have been talking too. Loosely based on Snapchat **Chapp.** Differentiates itself with a PC and text oriented design allowing texting on the computer while maintaining a responsive design for those on mobile as well as an increased accuracy in achivement status. Its open-source nature also allows for private hosting and internal usage among friend groups as well as allowing for modified versions of the program.
